Please note: This project was initially built following Sebastian Lague's tutorial series on 3D landscape generation.

I watched part of the series while working on other projects and finally decied to follow along as it touched on many parts of Unity that I am unfamiliar with.

Unlike the 2D project, I have taken some liberties with the code and intend to expand and change it over time to make it more of my own.
