## Purpose

This repository is simply what the title suggest it is. I use this repo to store various Unity-based prototypes I am working on. Feel free to clone this repo and mess with these projects as you like!

## Project Overviews:  

### Swap Shot

<p align="center"><img width=100% src="media/swapShotGif.gif"></p>

#### *Is there a tutorial?* 
No

#### Purpose: 

I created this project to practice producing a short prototype in my some of my free-time off work. This included using blender to make my own 3D models, Adobe Photoshop to hand draw and produce all my own art assets, as well as produce a Quake III Arena style movement system with various improvements to tailor the design to my idea.

 The aesthetic of this project was probably my favourite to design. I knew I wanted to contrast the *difficult* platforming with a soothing oceanscape reminiscent of the good-ole N64 days with a very visually guiding easy to interpret level design. 

 Of the prototypes in this repository, I think this is my favourite.

### The Tower

<p align="center"><img width=100% src="media/theTowerGif.gif"></p>

#### *Is there a tutorial?* 
Nuh-uh

#### Purpose:

I created this project after reading the story *The Red Tower* by Thomas Ligotti - a surreal stream-of-conciousness short story about a peculiar world governed by esoteric rules. I feel that description makes this project sound a bit more exciting that what it really is. The prototype is a simple wave defense game dressed up with tons of *juicy* particle effects and a three-color design.

I hope to expand this game over time with simple, non-intrusive, game elements to make it stand out a bit more.

### Wall Jump

<p align="center"><img width=100% src="media/wallJumpGif.gif"></p>

#### *Is there a tutorial?* 
Yes!

<p align="center"><img width=100% src="media/wallJumpTutorialGif.gif"></p>

#### Purpose:

I created *Wall Jump* as a way to test my ability to take various design limitations and create something that felt fun just to control. This gave way to the *unique* player controller of Wall Jump! 

I am hoping to expand this prototype into becoming more of a boss-rush-style game where each level has you fighting in a "bullet-hell" fashion. This would require the player to become adept with the controls and allow for an exciting, sorta kinda, new approach to the "bullet-hell" genre.

### Katamari Gameplay

<p align="center"><img width=100% src="media/katamariGameplayGif.gif"></p>

#### *Is there a tutorial?* 
Nope

#### Purpose:

This project was another player controller exercise to mimic - one of my favourite games - Katamari Damacy(塊魂). I wanted the prototype controller to look and handle like a more modern take on the classic arcade roll-em-up series. 

This project, as well as Swap Shot taught me a lot about how to traverse Unity's implementation of the NVIDIA PhysX middelware. By that, I mean I spent soooo much time battling the physics engine to do what I needed it to.

## Dependencies

All three projects take advantage of the open-source Unity [DOTween library](https://github.com/Demigiant/dotween) for various forms of smooth interpolation. This library really helps add *juice* at a low implementation cost and is far more performant than using Unity animations most all of the time. (The daisy chaining functionality of this library is just fantastic!)

All three of these projects also use [Cinemachine](https://unity.com/unity/features/editor/art-and-design/cinemachine), which is a fantastic asset for creating more dynamic cameras in Unity. I highly suggest giving it a look if you are tired of constantly adapting Unity's default cameras to do your bidding.

## Q&A

### _Q_: Isn't sharing your prototypes publically typically a bad idea?

**A**: Ye', probably!

### _Q_: Why do your assets look so primitive?

**A**: Well sometimes it's a stylistic choice, and other times it is because I enjoy making all my own assets and shaders (when viable). However, this does infact hinder what I can do and how attractive I can make my projects look. I try to make up for this by adding lots of *juice*!

### _Q_: What is up with the Swap Shot prototypes name?

**A**: The original design of the prototype was to create a game that would have you speed running through a level by swapping between various enemies that scatter the level by "shooting your consciousness". However, as I began developing the project, my already limited free time was being devoured by creating assets. So, I put the mechanic on hold until I have the proper time to give its implementation.
