Please note: This project is entirely built from Sebastian Lague's tutorial series.

I watched part of the series while working on other projects and finally decied to follow along as it touched on many parts of Unity that I am unfamiliar with.

So once again, I do not take credit for the code here. This is a link to his Youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3
